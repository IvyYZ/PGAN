## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) (We run the code under version 0.3.1, maybe lower versions also work.)

## Getting Started

### Installation
- Install dependencies (e.g., [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) and [dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate)). You can install all the dependencies by:
```
pip install scipy, pillow, torchvision, sklearn, h5py, dominate, visdom
```
## Run code
```
sh train.sh
```
